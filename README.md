# SONAR kinetic Monte Carlo model

PROJECT SUMMARY
This python coded model aims to simulate the discharge of the anode materials in a redox flow battery system. The defaut material is methyl viologen. 
The discharging process is simulated by kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. In each iteration, the algorithm chooses one event to execute and update the system configuration.
The main function is written in the 'simulate_SONAR_RFB.py'. The related kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm is coded in the 'particles_CC.py'. 
The 'initialize_kMC_run.py' is for initialization. The input parameters can be altered in 'user_input_SONAR.ini'

KMC MODEL
The kinetic Monte Carlo model adopted in this work is called the Variable Step Size Method. The algorithm first identified all the possible events based on the current configuration of the simulation box and then randomly chooses an event to execute in each iteration. The configuration and the characteristics of the system is then updated according to the chosen event. The cutoff condition is the simulation time.

DOUBLE LAYER MODEL
The Double Layer model is immplemented to capture the formaiton of the electrical double layer, and its impact on ion motions. The electrical double layer is considered as seperated zones of compact layer and diffuse layer. The electrode potential is the sum of the potential drop thorugh the compact layer and the potential on the interface between the diffuse layer and the compact layer. The compact layer is considered as a capacitor. and electrical field distribution in the diffuse layer is solved by Poisson Equation.   

OUTPUT FILES
There will be three output files. 
The output file with '.txt' records the simulation results, including the simualtion time, time step, electrode charge density, the potential drop thorugh the compact layer, the potential on the interface between the compact layer and the diffuse layer, and the type of events.
The output file with '.xyz' records the location of each ions. To visualise the 3D configuration of the simualtion box, users can use the software Ovito to process.
The output file with '.log' is the logfile which doesn't contain simulation results.

POST PROCESSING
Related post-processing code will be released later
